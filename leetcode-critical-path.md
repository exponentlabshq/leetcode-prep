Got it 👍 I see the diagram you uploaded (the same one with **Arrays & Hashing → Two Pointers/Stack → Sliding Window/Linked List/Binary Search → Trees → Tries/Heap/Backtracking**).

Now, based on that flow **and the structured repository strategy you outlined**, here’s a **critical path** to *nail LeetCode efficiently*:

---

# 🚀 Critical Path for LeetCode Mastery

Think of this as the **minimal path through the decision tree** that maximizes coverage of **core interview patterns**.

---

## **1. Foundation Layer**

**Arrays & Hashing**

* Why: Almost every problem starts here (arrays, strings, hash maps).
* Focus:

  * Prefix Sum (Running Sum, Subarray Sum Equals K)
  * Hash Map patterns (Two Sum, Anagrams, Frequency Count)
  * Set patterns (Contains Duplicate, Unique Elements)

✅ Milestone: Instantly map “frequency”, “running sum”, “duplicate” → Hashing or Prefix Sum.

---

## **2. Two Pointers + Stack (Next Level Building Blocks)**

* **Two Pointers**: Essential for sorted arrays, palindrome checks, and pair-sum style problems.

  * Practice: Two Sum Sorted, 3Sum, Valid Palindrome, Container with Most Water.
* **Stack**: Key for parentheses matching, monotonic stacks, and expression evaluation.

  * Practice: Valid Parentheses, Min Stack, Daily Temperatures, Next Greater Element.

✅ Milestone: Recognize `"valid parentheses"`, `"next greater"`, `"palindrome"`, `"X sum"` instantly.

---

## **3. Derived Patterns from Two Pointers**

* **Sliding Window**: Substrings and subarrays, usually with “longest/shortest” wording.

  * Practice: Longest Substring Without Repeating, Minimum Window Substring.
* **Linked List**: Two-pointer extensions (fast/slow pointers).

  * Practice: Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists, Detect Cycle.
* **Binary Search**: Sorted arrays, rotated arrays, search boundaries.

  * Practice: Binary Search, Search in Rotated Sorted Array, First/Last Position.

✅ Milestone: Keywords like `"substring"`, `"without repeating"`, `"sorted"`, `"rotated"` map directly.

---

## **4. Trees (Core DS/Algo Layer)**

* Binary Tree Traversals (DFS, BFS).
* Binary Search Trees (validation, lowest common ancestor).
* Recursion & divide-and-conquer mental models.

✅ Milestone: Any mention of “tree” → BFS/DFS template comes naturally.

---

## **5. Advanced Specializations**

* **Tries**: Prefix-based problems (autocomplete, word search).
* **Heap / Priority Queue**: Top K, scheduling, streaming problems.
* **Backtracking**: Generate all permutations/combinations/subsets.

✅ Milestone: “Top K” → Heap. “Generate all” → Backtracking. “Prefix” → Trie.

# 📈 The Lean Path (Minimal Effort, Maximum Coverage)

1. **Arrays & Hashing** → Build intuition with prefix sum & hash maps.
2. **Two Pointers + Stack** → Get comfortable with symmetry, sums, monotonic patterns.
3. **Sliding Window + Linked List + Binary Search** → Derived from Two Pointers.
4. **Trees (DFS/BFS)** → Recursion & traversal mastery.
5. **Heap + Backtracking + Tries** → Advanced, but fewer interview questions cover them (high ROI when needed).

---

# 🎯 Success Formula

1. **Keyword spotting** (from problem statement).
2. **Pattern mapping** (via decision tree).
3. **Apply template** (no guesswork).
4. **Complexity check** (always explain).

---

👉 In other words: **Arrays & Hashing → Two Pointers + Stack → Sliding Window/Linked List/Binary Search → Trees → Heap/Backtracking/Tries** is your **critical interview prep path**.

Would you like me to **turn this into a “study roadmap” (with recommended problem sets at each step)**, so you can practice in the exact order of the critical path?
