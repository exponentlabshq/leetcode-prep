# LeetCode Python Beginner

A beginner-first path into arrays/lists using a bookshelf metaphor, mapped to LeetCode-ready practice. This folder contains the core lesson, a printable cheat sheet, and two long-form narrative guides that extend the library analogy.

## What's inside

- `leetcode-python-beginner-0.md` — Pillar 1: Lists (Arrays in Python)
  - Metaphor-first code (`shelf`, `book`, `slot_index`) with ASCII diagrams
  - Core skills: access, slice, update, append/remove, iterate, alias vs copy
  - Extensions: list comprehensions, nested lists/grids, sorting
  - Dual-view (metaphor ↔ domain) examples and 1-minute practice templates
- `leetcode-lists-cheatsheet.md` — One-page printable cheat sheet
  - Quick reference (metaphor ↔ code ↔ CS term)
  - Core ASCII diagrams (slicing, update/append/remove, copy vs alias)
  - Dual-view snippets, pitfalls, and a micro practice template
- `leetcode-library.md` — Narrative mental models for data structures
  - Arrays, hash maps, sets, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs
  - Why mental models matter; Big-O as the performance compass
- `leetcode-library-speech.md` — Long-form “head librarian” speech
  - Story-driven walkthrough of data structures, patterns, and Big-O
  - Practical comparisons (O(n²) vs O(n), BFS vs DFS, sorting tradeoffs)

## Quick start

- Open `leetcode-python-beginner-0.md` and skim:
  - ASCII “Mental Model”, then “Skills with Rich Examples”
  - Mini exercises at the end of each section
  - Optional: jump to List Comprehensions, Grids, Sorting
- Keep `leetcode-lists-cheatsheet.md` side-by-side while practicing.

## Teaching principles (used throughout)

- Beginner-first naming (no shorthands): `shelf`, `book`, `slot_index`
- Comments align with code and the metaphor
- Dual-view examples: metaphor for intuition, domain for LeetCode transfer
- Small wins: 1-minute practice blocks after each concept

## Suggested progression

1) Lists basics → 2) Slicing/updates → 3) Iteration → 4) Copy vs alias →
5) List comprehensions → 6) Nested lists/grids → 7) Sorting → 8) Map to problems

## Printables

- Use `leetcode-lists-cheatsheet.md` for a 1-page printout (monospace friendly).

## Contributing

- Keep the bookshelf metaphor consistent in beginner materials
- Prefer dual-view examples when introducing new operations
- Avoid `nums`, `arr`, `i`; use domain names or `numbers`, `index` as needed
