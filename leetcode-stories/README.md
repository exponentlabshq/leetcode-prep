# LeetCode Stories: Domain-Specific Learning Guides

This directory contains the core storytelling-based learning guides that use real-world analogies to teach data structures, algorithms, and Big O notation. Each story features a hero character who grows through challenges, making complex concepts accessible and memorable.

### üçΩÔ∏è **Restaurant** (`leetcode-restaurant.md`)
- **Hero**: Chef Isabella "Bella" Rodriguez
- **Focus**: Culinary arts, service management, customer satisfaction
- **Key Concepts**: Kitchen coordination, order processing, service optimization
- **Data Structures**: Ingredient inventory (arrays), customer database (hash maps), allergens (sets)
- **Algorithms**: Order validation (two pointers), service monitoring (sliding window), workflow optimization (DP)

### üìö **Library** (`leetcode-library.md`)
- **Hero**: Luna Chen
- **Focus**: Information management, knowledge organization, research assistance
- **Key Concepts**: Catalog systems, information retrieval, knowledge organization
- **Data Structures**: Book shelves (arrays), digital catalog (hash maps), genre classifications (sets)
- **Algorithms**: Catalog validation (two pointers), usage monitoring (sliding window), research assistance (DFS/BFS)

## Foundation Documents

### üìñ **Library Analogy** (`leetcode-mental-models-library-analogy.md`)
The original foundation document that established the library analogy for data structures. This was the first blog post that introduced the storytelling approach.

### üîó **Patterns & Algorithms** (`leetcode-patterns-algorithms-library-analogy.md`)
The second blog post that built on the library analogy to show how patterns and algorithms interact with data structures. This established the comprehensive framework.

## Why These Stories Work

1. **Amygdala-Friendly Learning**: Familiar contexts reduce fear and anxiety
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Same coordination patterns across different domains
3. **Character-Driven**: Heroes provide emotional connection and motivation
4. **Big O Made Simple**: Performance concepts explained through real-world scenarios
5. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Learning patterns in one domain applies to others

## How to Use These Guides

1. **Start with any story** that interests you most
2. **Follow the hero's journey** through challenges and growth
3. **Practice the problems** at the end of each guide
4. **Compare patterns** across different stories to see the universal principles
5. **Apply the mental frameworks** to new LeetCode problems

Each guide is self-contained but designed to work together as a comprehensive learning system that builds intuition for algorithmic thinking through storytelling.
